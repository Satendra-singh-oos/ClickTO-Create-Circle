- Create-Shape-Dot is an interactive web project that allows users to create circles on a webpage by clicking on it. Each circle appears at the location where the user clicked, and gradually fades away over time. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and dynamic user experience. It can be used to demonstrate basic web development skills or as a starting point for more complex web projects.
